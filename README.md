#Discussion about managing state in the project 

    There are some attractive feature in my project like multiple selection warning,total price count ,total credit hour count,remaining crdit hour count etc.firstly I thought where I can declare the states so that props drriling will easy for me and code will more efficient.
    For total price,remaining credit hour,total credit hour and diplaying the cards i declared useState in the app.jsx file. I used useEffect to fecth the fake data I made.Then I passed the props to the child component.I reacieved the props from the child components,distructured  and display the feauture dynamically.
